# Udacity Project Portfolio Site

In this project I built a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a 
PDF-file and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive
website that displays images and (inactive) links to each of my future portfolio
projects. I used my own custom images to personalize this project.

## Setup

- Make sure you have python and git installed.
- clone the master fork from https://github.com/josejimenezjr0/projectPortfolio.git

## How to run

Simple version

- Open the index.html from within the folder structure.

Slightly less simple version to view on mobile devices

- Have computer and mobile devices within the same friendly wi-fi network
- From your computer in a terminal execute the following code from the root directory with the index file:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

```
- Find your local computer IP Address
- From any device on the same wi-fi in the address bar type in:

```
<your serve IP Address>:8000

```
